# Ti-Slag Sample Project

> Just a simple test project to try and get testing and code coverage working with Appcelerator using http://k0sukey.github.io/ti-slag/

* Testing with Mocha = possible
* Code coverage when using classic = possible
* Code coverage when using Alloy = almost possible and not very useful

#### Running tests
```javascript
npm test
```

#### Running code coverage
```javascript
npm run coverage
```
